# Analysis of Clauses in Marijuana Discourse on Reddit 

To run the notebooks in this repo, you need the following - 
1. reddit_50_both_inferred.db database (with the classified clauses table)
2. If you want to re-obtain the phi values for some reason, you need the word_topic_assignmented.pkl file. 
^ Both of these are not in the repo 

:)

## TODO:

1. Save the phi values in a better format than python files
